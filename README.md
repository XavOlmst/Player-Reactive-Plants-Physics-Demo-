# Player-Reactive-Plants-Physics-Demo-

## Project Objectives
As a player is walking through areas with foliage, the foliage reacts to their movement in a way similar to real life plants.
This project is significant to my career as a physics programmer as it makes me think about how phyisics is used in games to add player feedback. It will also be optimized to limit any affect on gameplay. 

## Tools
The project will be made in Unreal Engine, which will allow me to showcase the limits of my system in a high powered game engine. 

## Scope
Plants will move in a direction away from a character using capsule collisions and springs. The plants will slowly reset back to their initial state. The plants will also be able to react to wind and any other forces. The main limitation of this project will be balancing feel along side optimization. 

## Deliverable
This project will have a videoshowcase for the deliverable, along with a spreadsheet including performance numbers using different settings.
